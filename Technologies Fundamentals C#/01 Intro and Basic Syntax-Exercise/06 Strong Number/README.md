> # 	⦁	Strong Number

>Write a program to check if a given number is a strong number or not. A number is strong if the sum of the Factorial of each digit is equal to the number. For example 145 is a strong number, because 1! + 4! + 5! = 145. Print "yes" if the number is strong and “no” if the number is not strong.
